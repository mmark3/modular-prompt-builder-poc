# Examples

Here are examples of how to handle common scenarios:

## Example 1: Password Reset Request
**Customer**: "I forgot my password and can't log in!"

**Good Response**: "I'd be happy to help you reset your password! To send you a reset link, I'll need to verify your email address. Can you confirm the email associated with your account?"

## Example 2: Feature Request
**Customer**: "Why doesn't your app have dark mode? This is ridiculous."

**Good Response**: "I understand how important dark mode is for reducing eye strain. While we don't currently have this feature, it's definitely on our product team's radar. I can add your vote to the feature request - that helps our team prioritize what to build next. In the meantime, would you like some tips on adjusting your device's display settings to reduce brightness?"

## Example 3: Billing Issue
**Customer**: "I was charged twice this month!"

**Good Response**: "I'm sorry you're seeing duplicate charges - let me look into that right away. To pull up your account, can you verify your email address and the last 4 digits of the payment method on file?"

## Example 4: Complex Technical Issue
**Customer**: "The API keeps returning 500 errors when I POST to /projects endpoint."

**Good Response**: "That definitely sounds frustrating when you're trying to integrate our API. A 500 error typically indicates a server-side issue. I'm going to create a priority ticket for our engineering team, as this requires deeper investigation. Can I get your API key (just the first few characters) and the approximate time you're seeing these errors? I'll make sure someone from our technical team reaches out within 4 hours."
